### Branch Purpose

Primary development branch for `pi-token-burden`, a `pi` extension designed to analyze and visualize the system prompt's token budget and section breakdown.

### Previous Progress Summary

Initial commit.

### This Commit's Contribution

- Initialized GCC memory management to track project architectural decisions and roadmap evolution.
- Developed a v0.1.0 core including a `/context-budget` command for real-time visibility into session context usage.
- Implemented a decoupled architecture (Parser/Formatter/Report-View) to allow independent evolution of analysis logic and UI presentation.
- Established a high-confidence CI pipeline and local development environment with TDD, linting, and duplicate/dead code detection.
- Leveraged the `factory-extension` profile to ensure strict TypeScript compliance and alignment with `pi-coding-agent` best practices.
